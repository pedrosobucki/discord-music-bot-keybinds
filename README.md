# Discord Music Bot Keybinds
Keyboard shortcuts for using Discord Music bots

## Step 1:
Instal [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com) from AutoHotKey's website.

## Step 2:
Download the .ahk files and execute the one which corresponds to your type of keyboard.
- If your keyboard has a Numeric Keypad, execute the [discord_music_bot_hotkeys_numpad.ahk](https://github.com/pedrosobucki/discord-music-bot-keybinds/blob/master/discord%20_music_bot_hotkeys_numpad.ahk) file.
- If your keyboard does not have a Numeric Keypad, execute the [discord_music_bot_hotkeys_f1.ahk](https://github.com/pedrosobucki/discord-music-bot-keybinds/blob/master/discord%20_music_bot_hotkeys_f1.ahk) file.

## Step 3:
Change your Discord "Toggle Overlay Lock" keybind to SHIFT + TAB:

That is already enough to use the keybinds, as listed here:

## SHORTCUTS:
- help = Ctrl + h
- connect = Ctrl + Enter
- disconnect = Ctrl + Backspace
- pause = Ctrl + up
- resume = Ctrl + down
- next = Ctrl + right
- back = Ctrl + left
- Customizable sounds = Ctrl + Numpad digit  *OR*  Ctrl + F1-F9 

## Step 4 (optional):
###### Customizable Sounds
In order to customize the shortcut sounds, you need to right click the .ahk file and click on "Edit Script":

Then find the "^Numpad" blocks of text coresponding to the key you want to reassign and replace the ";INSERT LINK HERE" text with the audio link you want assigned in that key (youtube, spotify, etc): [Example Image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ncmh0FZoaM_5U59RsH_D3AR8dU6zerWO/view?usp=sharing)
